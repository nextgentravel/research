# Public Services and Procurement Canada - User recruitement

The NextGen Travel Team and Code for Canada cohort 3 fellowship team stationed at Public Services and Procurement Canada is looking to recruit participants for user research for our project. This is a landing page to send as part of our recruitement that contains privacy notices, an overview of the project, and who we are looking to talk to.

The site is hosted using Github Pages at: https://nextgentravel.github.io/research/
